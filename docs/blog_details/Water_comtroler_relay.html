        <h2>My First ESP8266 Project: Controlling an Electric Water Pump via Telegram</h2>
        <h4>(Technically not my first project but this the first one I am loading about)</h4>
      <p> So I had a problem with managing the water for my whole house (we use a lot of water)<br><br>
    so we had to turn the pump on and off often and it was hard to manage with all the other things we had to do<br>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Manually turning on and off the water pump was inconvenient.</li>
        <li>countinuous run for hours without know how turen it on or of, why and when(we are human erroes are commen)</li>
        <li> and sometimes we forget to turn it off, wasting water and energy adn over fulling the tank multiple times</li>
        <li> the tank is in 8 floor??? (idk its complicated) so it not possible to check the tank level manually</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>The Needs for the solution</h3>
    <ul>   
        <li>Automate the water pump control</li>
        <li>keep a log when it turned off and on</li>
        <li>multiple people need to have access from anywhere in the house or outside(or world lol)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>What i did to create solution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> already had an ESP8266 module(because cheap)</li>
        <li> used an relay module to control the pump</li>
        <li> and using Telegram bot api(because free)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>  
      <h3>The Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ESP8266 Module (node mcu)</li>
        <li>Relay Module x 2 (12volt controlled and 5 volt controlled)</li>
        <li>Electric Water Pump(already there)</li>
        <li>voltage booster module (to step up the 5V to 12V)</li>
        <li>voltage regulator (to step down the 5V to 3.3V for the esp8266)</li>
        <li>Power Supply(cheap 5 volt micro usb adapter)</li>
        <li>Telegram Bot API(free!!!! with limites ofc ther is no such things as free lunch)</li>
        <h6>(I am not including the cost because i dont rember but you can check out my code at my github)</h6>
      </ul>

      <h2> The first Prototype</h2>
      <p> using a bread board and a esp8266 i made a simple prototype to control the water pump</p>
      
      <div class="responsive-iframe">
        <iframe
          src="#" ##add your img link here
          allow="autoplay">
        </iframe>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Not my best work but it gets the job done<br>
        The problem is it kept overheating and the code was a MESS <br>
      </p>

      <h2>The Final Version</h2>
        <p> So after a lot of soldering, took me a day to make the final version<br>
        I made a handmade pcb and soldered all the wires myself<br>
        I also made a simple enclosure to protect the electronics from dust and water(A green plastic box , i dont have 3d printer)<br>

        To be honest the orginal plan was to make an the 12 volt relay controled by an mosfet<br>
        but the shop didn't have the parts I needed so I had to improvise(there is nothing bad about improvising)<br>
        I used a 5 volt relay instead which controles the 12 volt relay<br>
