      <h2>Why I Broke My First ESP8266 (And What I Learned)</h2>
      <p> Well it all started with me trying to power an LED array like the long PCB with LED (which I got from taking apart an old led light,broken).<br><br>
        So i was trying to controle the led with my esp8266 with an GPIO pin(my first mistake), and it did light up but was dim, so i thought<br><br>
        I should power it with a 5V source directly to the Vin pin of the esp8266, and yes it worked for a few seconds and a capacitor on the esp started smoking<br><br>
        and yep (my second mistake) I saw it burn and the esp8266 was dead.
      </p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Always check the voltage and current requirements of your components before connecting them.</li>
        <li>Use a separate power supply for high-power components like LED arrays instead of powering them directly from the microcontroller.</li>
        <li>Consider using a transistor or a MOSFET to switch high-power loads instead of driving them directly from GPIO pins.</li>
        <li>Double-check your wiring and connections to avoid accidental shorts or incorrect connections.</li>
      </ol><br>
      <p>In conclusion, breaking my first ESP8266 was a valuable learning experience that taught me important lessons about electronics and circuit design. By being more cautious and informed in my future projects, I can avoid similar mistakes and build more reliable and efficient systems.</p><br>
      <p>Fortunately, the ESP8266 itself wasn't dead, only the power regulator was dead, 
        <br>so I desoldered it and using it with an ESP8266-01 programmer,
        <br>it works fine</p>
