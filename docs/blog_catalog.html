      <h2>Why I Broke My First ESP8266 (And What I Learned)</h2>
      <p> Well it all started with me trying to power an LED array like the long PCB with LED (which I got from taking apart an old led light,broken).<br><br>
        So i was trying to controle the led with my esp8266 with an GPIO pin(my first mistake), and it did light up but was dim, so i thought<br><br>
        I should power it with a 5V source directly to the Vin pin of the esp8266, and yes it worked for a few seconds and a capacitor on the esp started smoking<br><br>
        and yep (my second mistake) I saw it burn and the esp8266 was dead.
